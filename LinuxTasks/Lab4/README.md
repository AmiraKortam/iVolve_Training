Lab 4: Disk Management and Logical Volume Setup
Objective: Attach a 15GB disk to your VM, make 4 partitions from this disk 4GB, 2GB, 6GB
and 3GB. Use the 4GB partition as a file svstem. configure the 2GB partition as swap.
Initialize the second 5GB as a Volume Group (VG) with a Logical Volume (LV), 
then extend the LV by adding the last 3GBÂ partition.

Solution:

1. Attach 15GB
this is done from the VirtualBox interface and to make sure run lsblk

![sdb](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/109794c1-d3b0-4241-ba86-241ba73716c2)

2. Partition the 15G
   run command "sudo fdisk /dev/sdb" and partition using the interactive shell

![sdb22](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/100e9753-32fa-4aab-8f66-7f7cdb346232)

5. Modify partition 3 and 4 as needed

![sdb33](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3072ffc-fb16-4968-970f-36fe6ccd7de9)
![sdb333](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/119a9ff3-cd98-4db1-8796-e6bfa89417cf)
Mount the created lv
