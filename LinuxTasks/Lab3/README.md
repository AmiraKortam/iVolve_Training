Lab 3: Shell Scripting Basics
• Objective: Create a shell script that would ping every single server in the
172.16.17.x subnet where x is a number between 0 and 255. If a ping succeeds,
statement "Server 172.16.17.x is up and running" will be displayed. Otherwise,if a ping fails,
statement "Server 172.16.17.x is unreachable" will be displayed.

Solution:
1. Craete file with the following content
  ![script_new](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10013cc1-7b41-4ea4-a55d-35b9afaf96a5)
enable this file to run as a program (chmod +x scriptlab3.sh) and locate the file in the /usr/local/bin directory
2. Run the script
   ![script_run](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/239c2bae-de9e-4321-bb03-7d0d36fb322f)
